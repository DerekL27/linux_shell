# Linux Shell

This is the code for CS3650 Project 1

The [Makefile](Makefile) contains the following targets:

- `make all` - compile everything
- `make tokenize` - compile the tokenizer demo
- `make shell` - compile the shell
- `make shell-tests` - run a few tests against the shell
- `make test` - compile and run all the tests
- `make clean` - perform a minimal clean-up of the source tree


This shell is capable of basic shell operations (cd,ls,echo,etc.) and basic file operations, as well as tokenizing, sequencing, and piping.
